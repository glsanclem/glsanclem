Hello 👋 

- 👀  I’m interested in enhancing my technical skills. 

- 🌱  I’m currently learning R programming, SQL, and Tableau. I was always weiry of numbers-math-statistics-science and would walk along the social sciences 
      path, until one day I received constructive advice from a professor who advised me on the value of learning technical and practical skills, especially 
      during our current state of affairs.     
      
- 💡  My ah-ha moment came when I started taking the Google Data Analytics Certificate program and strangely, I realized that I like numbers, math, statistics,
      and science. What was I so afraid of all these years? The more I solved puzzles, the more fascinated I became in the subject matter and got lost in the 
      world of manipulating big data. Not lost to the point where it feels like work, but rather where time passes and you are still having fun. Where you immerse
      yourself in complex data, trying to figure out the right codes, and seeing results. I realized it felt like less of a job and more of a fun game to solve. 
      It's not so bad after all.
  
- 💞️  On the flip side of my left-brain analytical mind, I also have a passion for the non-technical-- I am an artist, poet, writer and yoga / meditation enthusiast.

- ✨ I have multiple passions and interested in many things, I learn to appreciate everything about life, and my interest in knowledge never ends. Thank you!
